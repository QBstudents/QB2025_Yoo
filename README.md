Student QB repo for Jaeyoung Yoo

Name: Jaeyoung Yoo
Email: jaeyyoo@iu.edu

I am Jaeyoung Yoo, a 2nd year PhD student in Environmental Science program at O'Neill School. My research is focused on interactions between plant and soil animals, especially how plant provide resources to soil food webs and how root herbivory change the resource provision of plants. I am focusing especially on nematodes, which are the most abundant animals in the globe and plays a significant role in nutrient cycling. I am looking forward to learning how to use GitHub as a collaborative tool, and how to statistically analyze the biodiversity indices in this course.
